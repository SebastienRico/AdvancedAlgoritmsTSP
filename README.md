The goal of this project is to resolve the Traveling Salesman Problem

You can choose as you want an existing map or a random map. Before that you can choose an approach to resolve this map.
Be careful, if you choose a map with lot of nodes (more than 10 nodes) you can't use the brut force and the dynamic approaches.
You can also try all possibilities with the button "Try all".

The path to follow to resolve the map with the time complexity are written on the console of the IDE.

We advise you to use the Netbeans IDE. You just need to open the project and run it.
